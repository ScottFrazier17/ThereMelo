# Getting Started

Computer vision is integrating itself into our society every passing day. We aim to integrate the use of computer vision into the field of music which also has a great impact on our daily lives. ThereMelo is a way to create music that will make it more accessible to those who may not have the ability as a result of the current state of music creation. All someone needs to have access to is a camera in order to realize their creative musical ideas.

The ThereMelo is a product that utilizes the Leap Motion Controller 2 to read the userâ€™s hands to translate them into sound. Users of the ThereMelo will be able to play the instrument in a sandbox environment and learn how to play the Theremin. We want the Theremelo to accessible for anyone of any age to play with.
