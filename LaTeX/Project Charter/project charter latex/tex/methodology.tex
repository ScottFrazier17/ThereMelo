We are going to be creating software which will use the users camera and convert their hand movement into sound. Our software would simulate how a real theremin would work, where the users' dominant hand would be calculated in relative to their non-dominant hand to produce sound. The application would allow the user to enter a sandbox environment, where they are able to use the theremin however they want, or follow along in a few interactive tutorials to learn how to play the instrument with some selected songs.
