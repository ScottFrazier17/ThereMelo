Our work should be funded because we want to introduce our application to younger generations to inspire them into STEM, mainly Computer Science. Our current sponsor, Shawn N. Gieser, also suggested that as well. This is beneficial, as the project may jump-start a new generation of STEM students. Music is highly influential, so lending the application to the audience may pique their interest in how the application manages to translate their hand movements into sound, which can produce music.
