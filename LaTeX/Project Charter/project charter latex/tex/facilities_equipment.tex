We would need a dedicated lab space that has enough room for us to setup the camera to work on our project. We need the lab/testing space to have sufficient lighting conditions and an open area where we could carry out our tests for the project. The lab space should be free from any sort of interference that might the disrupt the performance of the UltraLeap. 

Our project requires hand tracking to simulate a theremin, so our main purchase would be the Leap Motion Controller 2 by UltraLeap. We plan to use Unity development software and licenses, to create the theremin's virtual interface. We will use GitHub, to collaborate and work on the program together as a team. We might migrate over the Plastic SCM if the repository fills up. That would require a payment service. We have a group on Discord, which is our main platform to communicate and discuss about the projects.
