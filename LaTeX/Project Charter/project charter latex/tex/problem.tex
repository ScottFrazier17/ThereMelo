There are many reasons why we want to create the ThereMelo, and one of them is to exercise our musical interests. This project is also a great gateway to show the younger generation about STEM-related projects in a fun way. We want to show there is much more than just standard projects. 

Computer vision is integrating itself into our society every passing day. We aim to integrate the use of computer vision into the field of music which also has a great impact on our daily lives. ThereMelo is a way to create music that will make it more accessible to those who may not have the ability as a result of the current state of music creation. All someone needs to have access to is a camera in order to realize their creative musical ideas.

Our aim is also to inspire the younger generation to take up an interest in STEM. We believe it is the job of the older generation to show the capabilities and to inspire others that STEM should be something that is fun and educational. That it can be more than just it seems.
